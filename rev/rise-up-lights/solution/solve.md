Roughly speaking, you can represent the system as a 1000x1000 matrix over Z2 (there are 1000 regions). Then solve the linear system (e.g. sage's `solve_right`) to identify which pieces you need to click on. Finally, use a script to simulate clicking on these items.

Identifying the adjacencies (i.e. which pieces are adjacent to which) requires either reverse engineering or reimplementing the code. You should end up with the same system either way.

```
e = document.createEvent("SVGEvents");
e.initEvent('click', true, true);
soln = [1,2,5,7,8,10,13,15,16,19,22,23,25,27,33,34,37,40,42,44,46,48,49,50,52,53,54,55,57,60,63,66,68,70,71,72,75,77,78,82,85,86,87,89,95,96,98,100,101,102,103,108,110,116,120,121,126,127,128,131,133,139,140,142,143,144,147,149,151,152,153,160,162,163,165,166,169,171,173,181,186,187,188,196,199,200,201,202,205,206,207,209,212,214,215,216,217,219,220,221,224,225,227,230,233,238,240,241,244,248,249,250,254,255,256,257,258,260,261,262,264,265,266,267,268,270,271,272,273,274,278,279,280,282,283,284,286,287,288,289,295,297,299,301,303,305,306,307,309,310,312,313,315,317,323,325,326,328,329,331,336,337,339,342,343,344,345,347,350,352,354,355,357,359,361,366,367,368,369,370,371,374,376,384,385,389,392,393,394,395,397,400,401,402,406,411,415,416,417,418,419,421,424,426,427,428,429,430,431,432,433,435,436,442,443,444,446,448,449,450,452,453,454,456,457,459,467,469,470,471,474,475,476,477,478,479,480,481,482,483,490,493,495,496,497,499,501,502,503,506,507,508,509,513,515,520,521,522,523,524,526,529,530,532,533,539,541,542,544,545,547,550,551,552,553,557,561,562,563,566,568,569,570,571,574,575,581,588,589,590,598,601,604,606,608,610,611,612,616,618,621,625,626,627,629,630,633,634,635,636,637,638,639,641,642,643,645,646,649,651,654,656,658,661,664,666,668,670,671,672,674,679,680,682,683,686,687,690,692,700,701,703,704,706,707,709,710,712,713,716,718,719,723,725,727,728,729,731,735,737,738,741,742,743,744,745,746,748,749,752,753,754,756,757,767,772,773,774,778,779,781,782,785,788,789,791,793,797,802,805,806,810,811,813,815,817,818,823,825,827,833,840,841,843,844,852,853,856,860,868,869,870,871,873,874,878,879,884,885,886,887,889,890,894,895,900,903,904,906,907,909,912,914,917,923,924,926,931,937,942,943,944,945,947,951,953,954,955,959,961,962,970,973,974,976,977,982,983,985,986,987,988,989,991,996,997,998,999];

```

This prints out the flag:

`oiccflag{say_it_fast,_it_sounds_like_razor_blades}`
